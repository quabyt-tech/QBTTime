  - Submit button for finalizing the week's entries.

  #### AI Enhancements (Optional)
  - Employees can describe tasks in plain language (e.g., "Worked 2 hours on backend bug fixing for Project A"), and the system auto-fills the fields (project, task description, hours).

    - Missing entries for a week.  
    - Unsubmitted weekly entries nearing the deadline.
